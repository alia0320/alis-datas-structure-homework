This is the option lab folder I made for the Generics Class.
I might have messed up the branch on the terminal, hence why you see that the commit name is called "Add files via upload".
I will probably figure out the solution for some time later, though I probably should not have used 'rm -rf .git' on the local repo
where I uploaded the "AnswerToReview.java" file.
